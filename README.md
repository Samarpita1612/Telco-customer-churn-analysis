# Telco-customer-churn-analysis
Project Objective
The goal of this project was to understand why customers are leaving a telecom service and what factors influence their decision to stay or go. By identifying these patterns, we aim to help the company reduce churn and improve customer retention using data-driven insights.

Tools and Technologies Used
•	Python for explanatory data analysis(EDA).
•	Pandas for handling and cleaning data.
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations.
•	Jupyter Notebook for carrying out and presenting the analysis
________________________________________
Key Problems Solved
•	Cleaned the dataset by fixing missing or blank values in the TotalCharges column
•	Made binary data more readable (for example, converting 0 and 1 in SeniorCitizen to "Yes" and "No")
•	Explored which features and customer types are more likely to churn
•	Visualized important patterns using charts to make the findings easier to understand

Churn Overview
•	About 26.5% of the customers in the dataset have left the service
•	The remaining 73.5% are still active customers
________________________________________
Key Findings
•	Customers with month-to-month contracts are much more likely to leave than those with one-year or two-year contracts
•	Senior citizens tend to churn more than non-senior customers
•	People who have only been with the company for a short time (especially around one month) are more likely to leave
•	Users with fiber optic internet have a higher churn rate than those with DSL or no internet service
•	Customers without services like Online Security, Online Backup, and Device Protection are more likely to churn
•	Not having Tech Support is strongly linked to churn, while those with support tend to stay longer
•	Features like Streaming TV and Streaming Movies don’t show a major difference in churn behavior
•	Gender doesn’t appear to affect whether a customer stays or leaves
•	From the above it is more likely that people without a partner churn out more than people with one.

Conclusion
The analysis shows that factors like contract type, length of time with the company, and access to support and security services play a big role in whether customers stay or leave. These insights can help the company create strategies that encourage customers to stick around longer—like offering better support, highlighting useful features, and promoting longer-term plans.
